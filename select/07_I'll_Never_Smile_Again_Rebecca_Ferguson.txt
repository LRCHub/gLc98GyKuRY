I'll never smile again, until I smile at you
I'll never laugh again, what good would it do?
For tears would fill my eyes, my heart would realize
That our romance is through

I'll never love again, I'm so in love with you
I'll never thrill again to somebody new
Within my heart, I know I will never start
To smile again, until I smile at you

Within my heart, I know I will never start
To smile again, until I smile at you
Until I smile at you
